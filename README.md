# 📚 Book Library CRUD App (Flask + SQLAlchemy)

This is a simple web-based book library application built using **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**, created as part of my journey learning **Python web development**. The project was developed with guidance from **The App Brewery's  Bootcamp on Udemy**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The app allows users to:

- 📝 Add new books (title, author, rating)  
- 🧾 View the full book list  
- 🔁 Update the rating of existing books  
- ❌ Delete books from the library  

It's a beginner-friendly CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app that connects HTML templates with a SQLite database using Python and Flask.
